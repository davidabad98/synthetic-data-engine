They were pretty clear about not wanting any explanations, just pure JSON. I need to make sure each entry follows the schema they provided.\n\nFirst, I should go through the fields one by one and assign appropriate values. The TFSA_ID needs to be in the format \"TFSA- followed by six digits,\" so I'll generate unique IDs for each example. \n\nNext, the AccountHolderName should be a realistic name. Maybe common first names like John, Jane, Alex, Emily, David paired with last names Doe, Smith, Brown, etc.\n\nThe Date of Birth (DOB) is in YYYY-MM-DD format. I'll choose dates spread across different months to have diverse examples. Also, ensuring the DOB makes the account holder eligible, which for TFSA is typically 18 or older, but since we're generating synthetic data, it's okay as long as it's a valid date.\n\nSocial Insurance Number (SIN) should be a string of nine digits. I'll use patterns like ABC123456, XYZ789012, etc., ensuring each example has a unique SIN.\n\nContributionLimit is an annual limit, so I'll pick numbers within the range 0 to 7000 for 2025. Since it's synthetic data, I can choose any number in that range. For CurrentContribution and AvailableContributionRoom, I need to make sure they add up correctly based on ContributionLimit. For example, if ContributionLimit is 7000 and CurrentContribution is 1500, then AvailableContributionRoom would be 5500.\n\nTotalBalance should reflect the contributions and investments over time. It's a bit tricky since it depends on returns, but for synthetic data, I can choose realistic numbers that make sense given the contributions and limits.\n\nAccountCreationDate needs to be in YYYY-MM-DD as well. Spreading these across different months ensures each example is unique.\n\nInvestmentTypes should be an array of strings from the provided enum: Mutual Funds, Insurance GICs, Segregated Funds, ETFs, Stocks, Bonds. I'll vary this list for each example to show different investment options within a TFSA.\n\nWithdrawalPolicy needs to describe tax-free withdrawals with any specific rules based on the investments. For mutual funds and ETFs, penalties might apply; for stocks and bonds, it's usually tax-free without penalties.\n\nResidencyRequirement should always be the standard Canadian requirement: being a resident aged 18 or older with a SIN.\n\nI'll make sure each JSON object is properly formatted, with commas separating fields and proper use of quotes. No markdown, just plain JSON as per the user's request.\n\nI also need to ensure that all fields are filled correctly without any missing values. Each example should be unique in terms of TFSA_ID, names, SINs, ContributionLimits, etc., to avoid duplication.\n\nFinally, I'll compile five examples, each with distinct and realistic data that fits within the schema provided. No explanations, just the JSON output as requested.\n</[INST]>"
